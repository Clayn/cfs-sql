# Clayn FileSystem SQL Implementation

This is a implementation of the CFS that works on a SQL Database. Because different database engines behave different there is no guarantee this implementation works for everyone in the current version. 
All databases that were used for tests will be listed though. 

In the future the implementation should be more flexible in how to connect and configure the database connection.

#### Tested with

###### Operating systems
- Windows 7 (64 bit)
- Mac OS X El Capitan (64 bit) 
- Linux Mint 18 (64 bit)

###### Databases (JDBC Driver)
- H2 (1.4.192)
- MySQL (6.0.4)


JUnit Tests are using H2 in version 1.4.192 for the tests
